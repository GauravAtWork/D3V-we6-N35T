  <p><br>
    This is to inform you that 30th Annual Kyoto Sister-School Goodwill Event will this year. a fierce competition that pits the teams of Tokyo and Kyoto students against each other in a series of intense jujutsu battles.<br><br> &ensp; Being Sukuna's vessel, I have gained immense strength and curse energy and am pretty about competiting in this event. So I request you to grant me permission to compete in the exchange event.
